Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release includes 'forward-looking information\u201d and 'forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, 'forward-looking information\u201d). All information, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events, or developments that Hut 8 expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements relating to scaling the Company's platform, commercializing and advancing the Company's data center opportunities, commencing the Company's contracts with IESO, unlocking the Company's near-term growth potential, the commercialization of the Company's Vega site through its hosting arrangement with BITMAIN and (following the execution of the Company's miner purchase option) American Bitcoin, closing the merger of American Bitcoin and Gryphon and completing the combined company's Nasdaq listing, , and the Company\u2019s future business strategy, competitive strengths, expansion, and growth of the business and operations more generally, and other such matters is forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

'Strategic wins across our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments increased the share of energy capacity under management commercialized under executed agreements with terms of one year or longer to nearly 90% at quarter-end, up from less than 30% a year ago, driving a meaningful shift from merchant exposure to long-term, contracted fees.\u201d 'These milestones build on the restructuring of our mining business with the launch of American Bitcoin. In addition to completing an oversubscribed private placement and advancing toward a Nasdaq listing, American Bitcoin is now a dedicated anchor tenant for our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. More broadly, this shift reflects the growing depth of our institutional partnerships, with marquee counterparties such as BITMAIN, Macquarie, Coinbase, and Anchorage each playing a central role in our execution this quarter.\u201d 'As we work to commercialize AI data center opportunities, we continue to apply the power-first, innovation-driven approach that has long defined our strategy and enabled us to build such partnerships. Initially energized during the quarter, Vega is a clear expression of that strategy: designed in-house and increasingly viewed by prospective partners as a prototype for next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this level of innovation and execution, grounded in first principles, speed, and capital discipline, not only differentiates us but positions us to be a category-defining leader as the sector continues to evolve.\u201d Second Quarter 2025 HighlightsPowerGenerated $5.5 million in second quarter revenue from Power Generation and Managed Services.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release includes 'forward-looking information\u201d and 'forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, 'forward-looking information\u201d). All information, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events, or developments that Hut 8 expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements relating to scaling the Company's platform, commercializing and advancing the Company's data center opportunities, commencing the Company's contracts with IESO, unlocking the Company's near-term growth potential, the commercialization of the Company's Vega site through its hosting arrangement with BITMAIN and (following the execution of the Company's miner purchase option) American Bitcoin, closing the merger of American Bitcoin and Gryphon and completing the combined company's Nasdaq listing, , and the Company\u2019s future business strategy, competitive strengths, expansion, and growth of the business and operations more generally, and other such matters is forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

'Strategic wins across our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments increased the share of energy capacity under management commercialized under executed agreements with terms of one year or longer to nearly 90% at quarter-end, up from less than 30% a year ago, driving a meaningful shift from merchant exposure to long-term, contracted fees.\u201d 'These milestones build on the restructuring of our mining business with the launch of American Bitcoin. In addition to completing an oversubscribed private placement and advancing toward a Nasdaq listing, American Bitcoin is now a dedicated anchor tenant for our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. More broadly, this shift reflects the growing depth of our institutional partnerships, with marquee counterparties such as BITMAIN, Macquarie, Coinbase, and Anchorage each playing a central role in our execution this quarter.\u201d 'As we work to commercialize AI data center opportunities, we continue to apply the power-first, innovation-driven approach that has long defined our strategy and enabled us to build such partnerships. Initially energized during the quarter, Vega is a clear expression of that strategy: designed in-house and increasingly viewed by prospective partners as a prototype for next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this level of innovation and execution, grounded in first principles, speed, and capital discipline, not only differentiates us but positions us to be a category-defining leader as the sector continues to evolve.\u201d Second Quarter 2025 HighlightsPowerGenerated $5.5 million in second quarter revenue from Power Generation and Managed Services.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release includes 'forward-looking information\u201d and 'forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, 'forward-looking information\u201d). All information, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events, or developments that Hut 8 expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements relating to scaling the Company's platform, commercializing and advancing the Company's data center opportunities, commencing the Company's contracts with IESO, unlocking the Company's near-term growth potential, the commercialization of the Company's Vega site through its hosting arrangement with BITMAIN and (following the execution of the Company's miner purchase option) American Bitcoin, closing the merger of American Bitcoin and Gryphon and completing the combined company's Nasdaq listing, , and the Company\u2019s future business strategy, competitive strengths, expansion, and growth of the business and operations more generally, and other such matters is forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

'Strategic wins across our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments increased the share of energy capacity under management commercialized under executed agreements with terms of one year or longer to nearly 90% at quarter-end, up from less than 30% a year ago, driving a meaningful shift from merchant exposure to long-term, contracted fees.\u201d 'These milestones build on the restructuring of our mining business with the launch of American Bitcoin. In addition to completing an oversubscribed private placement and advancing toward a Nasdaq listing, American Bitcoin is now a dedicated anchor tenant for our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. More broadly, this shift reflects the growing depth of our institutional partnerships, with marquee counterparties such as BITMAIN, Macquarie, Coinbase, and Anchorage each playing a central role in our execution this quarter.\u201d 'As we work to commercialize AI data center opportunities, we continue to apply the power-first, innovation-driven approach that has long defined our strategy and enabled us to build such partnerships. Initially energized during the quarter, Vega is a clear expression of that strategy: designed in-house and increasingly viewed by prospective partners as a prototype for next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this level of innovation and execution, grounded in first principles, speed, and capital discipline, not only differentiates us but positions us to be a category-defining leader as the sector continues to evolve.\u201d Second Quarter 2025 HighlightsPowerGenerated $5.5 million in second quarter revenue from Power Generation and Managed Services.

Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release includes 'forward-looking information\u201d and 'forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, 'forward-looking information\u201d). All information, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events, or developments that Hut 8 expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements relating to scaling the Company's platform, commercializing and advancing the Company's data center opportunities, commencing the Company's contracts with IESO, unlocking the Company's near-term growth potential, the commercialization of the Company's Vega site through its hosting arrangement with BITMAIN and (following the execution of the Company's miner purchase option) American Bitcoin, closing the merger of American Bitcoin and Gryphon and completing the combined company's Nasdaq listing, , and the Company\u2019s future business strategy, competitive strengths, expansion, and growth of the business and operations more generally, and other such matters is forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

'Strategic wins across our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments increased the share of energy capacity under management commercialized under executed agreements with terms of one year or longer to nearly 90% at quarter-end, up from less than 30% a year ago, driving a meaningful shift from merchant exposure to long-term, contracted fees.\u201d 'These milestones build on the restructuring of our mining business with the launch of American Bitcoin. In addition to completing an oversubscribed private placement and advancing toward a Nasdaq listing, American Bitcoin is now a dedicated anchor tenant for our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. More broadly, this shift reflects the growing depth of our institutional partnerships, with marquee counterparties such as BITMAIN, Macquarie, Coinbase, and Anchorage each playing a central role in our execution this quarter.\u201d 'As we work to commercialize AI data center opportunities, we continue to apply the power-first, innovation-driven approach that has long defined our strategy and enabled us to build such partnerships. Initially energized during the quarter, Vega is a clear expression of that strategy: designed in-house and increasingly viewed by prospective partners as a prototype for next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this level of innovation and execution, grounded in first principles, speed, and capital discipline, not only differentiates us but positions us to be a category-defining leader as the sector continues to evolve.\u201d Second Quarter 2025 HighlightsPowerGenerated $5.5 million in second quarter revenue from Power Generation and Managed Services.

Forward-looking information is often identified by the words 'may\u201d, 'would\u201d, 'could\u201d, 'should\u201d, 'will\u201d, 'intend\u201d, 'plan\u201d, 'anticipate\u201d, 'allow\u201d, 'believe\u201d, 'estimate\u201d, 'expect\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'can\u201d, 'might\u201d, 'potential\u201d, 'predict\u201d, 'is designed to\u201d, 'likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company\u2019s recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company\u2019s EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued operations, (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company\u2019s board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company\u2019s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company\u2019s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
